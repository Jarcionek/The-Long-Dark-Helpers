MUST HAVE:
- removing markers
- note markers
- creating new map
- switching between maps

NICE TO HAVE:
- nice icons for markers
- connector markers (clicking them will switch to another map)
    - open map at position of connector
    - warning when map A has connector to map B, but map B doesn't have connector to map A
    - handle multiple connectors to the same map (needed for some caves)
- zooming in and out (considering mouse pointer position)
- move map by dragging
