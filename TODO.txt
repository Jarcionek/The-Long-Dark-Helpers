MARKERS IMPROVEMENTS:
- allow to add custom icons by adding images to the folder
- on first run, copy existing icons into the folder
- merge Marker and Note classes, allow notes on both
- handle folders - create JMenus for them
- allow to change the icon of existing marker
- handle missing image files
- save migration
- more icons:
    - resources (wood, coal, cloth, scrap metal, car battery)
    - danger (bear, wolf, moose)
    - hunting ground (rabbit, deer)
    - collectibles (cairn)

- connector markers (clicking them will switch to another map)
    - open map at position of connector
    - warning when map A has connector to map B, but map B doesn't have connector to map A
    - handle multiple connectors to the same map (needed for some caves)
- remember window size and location
- zooming in and out (considering mouse pointer position)
- move map by dragging
