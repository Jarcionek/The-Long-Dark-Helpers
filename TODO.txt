- improve icons and add more resource icons (wood, coal, scrap metal, car battery, food/meat?, fish? crates?)

- add logging to file

- connector markers (clicking them will switch to another map)
    - open map at position of connector
    - warning when map A has connector to map B, but map B doesn't have connector to map A
    - handle multiple connectors to the same map (needed for some caves)
- remember window size and location
- zooming in and out (considering mouse pointer position)
- move map by dragging
